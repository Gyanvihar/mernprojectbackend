Objective: Show your React.js skills with a focus on user authentication, data fetching, and responsive design.

1. User Authentication System :
What it means: Set up a secure system where users can register, log in, and recover their passwords.

Additional Point (JWT Token): Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for added security.


About JWT:-
A JSON web token is JSON (JavaScript object notation) with some extra structure. JWTs include a header and payload that use the JSON format. Optionally, the tokens can be encrypted or signed with a message authentication code (MAC). Signed tokens are commonly referred to as JSON web signatures (JWS) and encrypted tokens as JSON web encryption (JWE).

How It works:-

2. Secrets Posting Section :
What it means: Create a friendly home screen where users can share secret messages. Each user can post only one secret.



3. Responsiveness Across Devices :
What it means: Make sure your app looks good and works well on different devices like tablets, desktops, and phones.
